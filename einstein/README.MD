Einstein

Even if you haven’t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that , wherein  represents energy (measured in Joules),  represents mass (measured in kilograms), and  represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second), per Albert Einstein et al. Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.

In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.

How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python einstein.py. Type 1 and press Enter. Your program should output:
90000000000000000
Run your program with python einstein.py. Type 14 and press Enter. Your program should output:
1260000000000000000
Run your program with python einstein.py. Type 50 and press Enter. Your program should output
4500000000000000000
You can execute the below to check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.
